            Protect yourself and others around you by knowing the facts and taking appropriate precautions. Follow advice provided by your local health authority.<br><br> To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
            <ul>
                <li>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
                <li>Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</li>
                <li>Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.</li>
                <li>Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
                <li>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneez</li>
                <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
                <li>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.</li>
            </ul>

            Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.

            <h4>Masks</h4>

            Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.
